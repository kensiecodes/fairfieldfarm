# Fairfield Farms

This is a design mock-up for an organic farm.

## Description

The farm is marketing their produce and CSA membership. The tone is friendly and community oriented, target audience would be adults. It features Next.js routing, Tailwind styling, and React component libraries. I made this for an article on my blog, to show how easy it can be to make beautiful static sites.

## Help

Some of the features aren't fully interactive. This is intentional! More could be added to the site if it were for a real client. This is just a mock-up.
